Why did I choose this interview method?

My initial interviews occurred organically. I decided to volunteer to pick up and deliver food to the local YMCA. 
In the process, I met EVOLVE volunteers who have had some experience using the app. I used this opportunity to conduct some hallway interviews. 
I spoke with 3 volunteers asking a few simple questions:

What were the research questions?

Have you completed any food audits for EVOLVE?

How do you feel about the paper and pencil process for collecting data?

Would you be interested in the food audit tool being accessible via app?

Insights from Initial Interviews

I need to conduct some competitive analysis of apps that are recognized as some of the best for data input.

Interview with 3/9 EVOLVE Food Audit Squad confirmed there is a need for the app to make the work of volunteers easier. 
This would also potentially motivate others in the community to use the app to collect more data. This is a possible solution for EVOLVE to solve its business problem.

Field Study - Conducted 3/19

I conducted a field study and observed Evolve volunteers audit a Family Dollar store. After the group completed the audit, I participated in the debrief. 
I used my notes and what I learned during the debrief to determine the design of the app.

Questions asked during debrief:

How do you feel about this process?

What was frustrating while completing the audit?

Do you have any suggestions for how this process might be improved?

Did you have all of the information you needed while conducting the audit? What information do you believe might been helpful to assist you while auditing?
