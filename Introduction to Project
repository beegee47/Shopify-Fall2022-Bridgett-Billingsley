Collaboration with EVOLVE

While working on my UX Certification Online, I realized that I wanted to pursue some real world projects. 
I inquired within my network about organizations that are impacting the St. Louis community positively. 
I was led to EVOLVE, a grassroots organization with a mission to create a more equitable food system for people of color and communities that have been marginalized. 
With my background in Nutrition and Human Performance, I was ready to tackle any User Experience challenges EVOLVE might have in their mission to serve the community.

The Product:

Food Auditing App for Small Grocery Stores and Food Markets.

Target Audience:

Early adopters of the App, EVOLVE Volunteer Food Auditing Squad, Food Retailers.

Problem that the product will solve:

I will be removing the paper and pencil process of conducting food audits. 
The product will save food auditor's time as well as provide a better experience while in the field collecting data. 
The app aims to reduce the amount of cognitive load and manual labor for the Food Auditing Squad.

Business Problem:

EVOLVE would like to partner with small retail stores that sell food to provide healthier choices with marginalized communities.

EVOLVE would like to increase the number of food audits completed by collaborating with small retail store businesses.
