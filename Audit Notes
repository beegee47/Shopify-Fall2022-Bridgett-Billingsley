The Audit

After spending time observing 5 Evolve food auditors, I better understood the challenges of conducting audits. 
I completed a task flow analysis and compared it to the task flow for the current food auditing tool.

After management approval to conduct the audit and dividing the work into two teams, I noticed that the teams did not follow the task flow outlined in the toolkit.
The teams immediately audited the food categories. Once the food categories were done, they went back to the first page of the audit tool kit to address questions about nicotine, alcohol and expired products. 
They also asked specifically about infant formula which does not have it's own category. A new category to check the expiration date of infant formula was created.

I optimized the flow of task to make the process more efficient and help auditors remember all of the tasks that should be completed while auditing. 
The optimized task flow will be used to create wireframe screens for the new food auditing app.
